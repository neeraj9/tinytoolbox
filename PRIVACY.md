# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 30, 2026**

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy applies to all desktop applications built from the tinytoolbox repository. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring complete transparency about how our applications operate.

## Overview

Our applications are designed with privacy as a core principle. They are standalone Windows desktop applications that run entirely on your local machine without requiring internet connectivity for their core functionality.

## Data Collection and Storage

### Local Collection Only

Our applications **collect and store data exclusively on your local device**. This means:

- **No Remote Transmission**: We do not transmit any data to remote servers, cloud services, or third parties.
- **No Online Analytics**: We do not send usage statistics, telemetry, or analytics data to external services.
- **No Remote Tracking**: We do not use cookies, tracking pixels, or any web-based tracking technologies that communicate with external servers.
- **Local Storage Only**: All application data, settings, and user-created content remain on your machine under your complete control.

### What Data We Collect Locally

Our applications may collect and store the following data **locally on your device only**:

- **Application Settings**: User preferences, configuration settings, and customization options are saved locally to maintain your personalized experience across sessions.
- **User-Created Content**: Any files, recordings, projects, or content you create using our applications are stored exclusively on your local machine in locations you specify.
- **Application State**: Session information, window positions, recent file lists, and other UI state data to restore your workspace.
- **Cache Files**: Temporary files may be created during operation for performance optimization and are stored locally.
- **Usage Data**: Local logs or operational data that help the application function properly, stored only on your device.

All locally collected and stored data remains under your complete control and can be deleted at any time by removing the application or deleting specific files.

## Data Security

Our applications implement the following security measures:

- **Local Processing**: All data processing occurs entirely on your local machine.
- **No Remote Transmission**: No user data, settings, or content is transmitted to external servers, third parties, or cloud services.
- **Secure Design**: Applications are built with security best practices to protect against unauthorized access to your local data.
- **Minimal Permissions**: Applications request only the minimum system permissions necessary for their intended functionality.

## Third-Party Services

Our applications **do not** integrate with or transmit data to any third-party services, analytics platforms, advertising networks, or external APIs.

## Network Access

While our applications may have the capability to access the internet (such as for optional features or future updates), the core functionality operates completely offline. Any network access, if implemented, will:

- Be explicitly optional and user-initiated
- Clearly communicate what data (if any) is being transmitted
- Never transmit personally identifiable information without explicit user consent

## Updates and Modifications

If we update our applications to include features that change how data is handled, we will:

- Update this Privacy Policy with a new "Last Updated" date
- Clearly communicate any changes through release notes
- Maintain our commitment to user privacy and local-first design

## Children's Privacy

Our applications do not knowingly collect any data from children or adults. All processing occurs locally on your device.

## Your Rights

As all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control:

- **Access**: You can access all data stored by our applications through standard file system navigation.
- **Modification**: You can modify settings and preferences through the application interface or by editing configuration files.
- **Deletion**: You can delete all application data by uninstalling the application and removing associated files.
- **Portability**: Your data is stored in standard formats on your local machine and can be backed up or moved at your discretion.

## Consent

By using our applications, you acknowledge that:

- You have read and understood this Privacy Policy
- You understand that our applications operate locally on your device
- You are responsible for backing up any data you create using our applications

## Disclaimer

While we design our applications with security and privacy as priorities, we recommend that users:

- Keep their operating system and security software up to date
- Use appropriate file permissions to protect sensitive data
- Follow general best practices for computer security

---

**Summary**: Our applications are privacy-first, local-only Windows desktop tools that may collect and store data on your device for functionality, but **never transmit any data to remote servers**. Your data stays on your machine, under your complete control.
